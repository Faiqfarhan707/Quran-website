        <section>
            <p>Islam is built upon five fundamental pillars that guide the beliefs, practices, and way of life of every Muslim. These pillars are essential for spiritual discipline, moral conduct, and social harmony.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="pillar">
            <img src="img/Shahadah-pic" alt="Shahadah">
            <h2>1. Shahadah (Faith)</h2>
            <p>The declaration of faith affirms that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad (PBUH) is His final messenger. This is the fundamental belief that distinguishes a Muslim and governs their way of life.</p>
            <p>By sincerely reciting the Shahadah, one enters the fold of Islam and acknowledges the absolute sovereignty of Allah.</p>
            <blockquote>“Whoever sincerely says, 'There is no god but Allah' will enter Paradise.” (Sahih Bukhari)</blockquote>
        </section>
        <section class="pillar">
            <img src="img/sermon-1.jpg" alt="Salah">
            <h2>2. Salah (Prayer)</h2>
            <p>Muslims pray five times a day at specific times: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha. Salah serves as a direct link between the worshiper and Allah, promoting discipline, purification, and humility.</p>
            <p>It strengthens faith, prevents wrongdoing, and fosters unity as Muslims worldwide pray in the same direction, facing the Kaaba.</p>
            <blockquote>“Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing.” (Qur'an 29:45)</blockquote>
        </section>
        <section class="pillar">
            <img src="img/zakat0-1.jpg" alt="Zakah">
            <h2>3. Zakah (Charity)</h2>
            <p>Zakah is an annual obligation that requires Muslims to give 2.5% of their savings to the needy. It purifies wealth, fosters social justice, and reduces economic disparity.</p>
            <p>This practice ensures that wealth is circulated within the community, helping those who are less fortunate while keeping the giver humble and mindful of Allah’s blessings.</p>
            <blockquote>“Establish prayer and give Zakah.” (Qur'an 2:110)</blockquote>
        </section>
        <section class="pillar">
            <img src="img/events-2.jpg" alt="Sawm">
            <h2>4. Sawm (Fasting)</h2>
            <p>During the month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, refraining from food, drink, and sinful behavior. This practice fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy for the less fortunate.</p>
            <p>Fasting is also a means of spiritual purification, allowing Muslims to strengthen their connection with Allah through increased prayer and reflection.</p>
            <blockquote>“O you who have believed, fasting has been prescribed upon you so that you may attain Taqwa.” (Qur'an 2:183)</blockquote>
        </section>
        <section class="pillar">
            <img src="img/events-1.jpg" alt="Hajj">
            <h2>5. Hajj (Pilgrimage)</h2>
            <p>Hajj is an annual pilgrimage to Mecca that every Muslim must undertake at least once in their lifetime if they are physically and financially able. It represents equality, humility, and submission to Allah.</p>
            <p>Pilgrims wear simple white garments (Ihram) to signify unity and stand together in worship, regardless of race or status. The rites of Hajj commemorate the trials of Prophet Ibrahim (AS) and reinforce the concept of devotion and sacrifice.</p>
            <blockquote>“Whoever performs Hajj with sincerity will return as pure as the day they were born.” (Sahih Bukhari)</blockquote>
